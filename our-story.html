                </div>
                <p> After teaching for 30 years in Sicilian high schools (as english teacher), our father decided to devote all his time to farming his familyâ€™s land, following their old traditions.
                </p>
                <p>Thus, he continued farming grapes and olives experimenting new ways of growing using only natural means to produce organic products, wine and olive oil.</p>
                <p><b>TODAY</b> he attends some fairs, manages personally the farm and support buyers/customers that come to visit us.</p>

                        <p>I got the MSc in Computer Engineering in 2009 and in the following years I worked as a pure Software designer and developer. Although I always loved my work, every year I felt more and more the need to do things to approach nature more.</p>
                        <p>That's why i decided to join my father and Roberto in ELIOS, in addition to ENGINEERING; making FARM activities that could feed my need of returning back to nature.</p>
                        <p>My passion for in-depth study in everything I do, brought me to attend a course of WINE TASTER (obtaining the ONAV certificate) and a course of BEEKEEPING (satisfying my passion for the bees).</p>

                </div>
                <p>Guido is one of our best friend and he joined us in ELIOS proposing a great WINE Project idea: making a Wine that is DIFFERENT, A NATURAL WINE.
                </p>
                <p>In his 6 years work experience as a WINEMAKER Consultant, he matured the awareness that Wine shouldn't be made using strange substances or as an artificial product; instead the man should, from his point of view, accompany natural wine making processes without intrusive and invasive intervention.
                </p>
                <p> THIS makes the wines really TYPICAL and CHARACTERISTIC of the territory from which grapes come.</p>
                <p>The idea of making natural wines comes from deep respect we have for nature and the concept of following the Nature makes us feel part of it. That's why we married Guido's idea.</p>
                <p><b>TODAY</b> he is responsible of following the wine making process and managing customers relationships.</p>
